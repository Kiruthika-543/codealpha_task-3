# Task Automation with Python Scripts

This project includes three different Python automation scripts:

## 1. Move JPG Files
Moves all `.jpg` files from one folder to another using `os` and `shutil`.

## 2. Extract Emails from Text
Reads a `.txt` file and extracts email addresses using regular expressions (`re`).

## 3. Scrape Webpage Title
Uses `requests` and `re` to fetch and extract the `<title>` tag from a web page.

## How to Use
- Make sure Python is installed.
- Replace any placeholder paths/URLs as needed.
- Run the scripts from terminal or IDE:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Requirements
- Python standard libraries (`os`, `shutil`, `re`, `requests`)
- For `requests`, install it with:
```bash
pip install requests
```
